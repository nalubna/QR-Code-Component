## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

In this project, I learned when to use display block, inline, grid, and flex.
And I also learned how to make a responsive design, so it'll fit both in mobile and desktop.

```css
section {
  display: block;
}
@media (min-width: 375px) {
    section {
        margin: 1rem auto;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

Although I still need to learn more about grid, because it's a bit tricky compared to flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48714783/cant-center-a-section-in-css) - This helped me to center the QR code section.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
