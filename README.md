## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

In this project, I learned when to use display block, inline, grid, and flex.
And I also learned how to make a responsive design, so the website will adjust to fit both in mobile and desktop screen size.

```css
section {
  display: block;
}
@media (min-width: 375px) {
    section {
        margin: 1rem auto;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

Although I still need to learn more about grid, because it's a bit tricky compared to flexbox.

### Useful resources
